# What do to to take remote QC or EPN/PDP shifts

Before you can take shifts you need to:
1. Take two online classes (one for QC shifts and one for EPN/PDP shifts)
2. Take three days of shifts

## 1. Sign up for classes:
- Visit: [https://alice-glance.cern.ch/alice/sams/classes/calendar?date=2021-08-31#](https://alice-glance.cern.ch/alice/sams/classes/calendar?date=2021-08-31#)
- If that does not work get to the same place the following way:
   - visit: [https://alice-glance.cern.ch/alice/sams/](https://alice-glance.cern.ch/alice/sams/)
   - Click on ```Classes``` (next to a graduation cap ![alt text](https://github.com/reynier0611/alice_shift_notes/blob/main/figs/F1.png "Classes button")) or the ```Calendar``` link right below ```Classes```
- Book a class for QC and a class for EPN/PDP shifts:
   - Click on the specific day where the class is offered
   - Click on ```Book class``` in the pop-up box
- Some emails with links and additional info will be emailed to you prior to the beginning of the classes
- Show up to the class by following the Zoom link provided in the email sent to you, and just sit back and pay attention while you drink a cup of coffee (the class will likely be offered at a very early time for Berkeley folks)
