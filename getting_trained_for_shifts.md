2. Take three days of shifts

Some emails with links and additional info will be emailed to you prior to the beginning of the classes
Show up to the class by following the Zoom link provided in the email sent to you, and just sit back and pay attention while you drink a cup of coffee (the class will likely be offered at a very early time for Berkeley folks)
